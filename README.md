# Summary

The "api-DockerCharts-PlotData-WeatherForecast" consists of a program that generates weather data to be plotted in intuitive graphs and dashboards, so that it is possible to map current weather conditions. This project is based on the adaptation of an oral test made by me at the "SPTech" college to be presented in the "Operating Systems" discipline.
